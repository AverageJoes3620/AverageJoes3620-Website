     <h2 style="font-family: Verdana"> FIRST Mission Statement</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif"> The mission of FIRST is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>
    <h2 style="font-family: Verdana">Our Team</h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif">We, the Average Joes, are just one of many robotics teams that make up FIRST Robotics. Mentors come in daily to help us Joes work through the process of making a robot. This helps us build extremely useful skills like marketing, engineering, technology, and science. We focus on inspiring young people to be science and technology leaders, engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs and helping foster well-rounded life skills.</p>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif">Every meeting we have a wide variety of activities to accomplish. Interested in writing code or doing CAD? We have a programming and CAD team. Want to use various machinery to create and assemble parts? There’s the build team for that. Like creating promotional stuff or presenting to sponsors? The marketing team would love to have you. And that’s not all! Joes work on advertising FIRST, use CAD to design various robot parts, and help out in our community with volunteer work like mentoring students from other schools and participating in Relay for Life. So don’t worry if you think you don’t want to actually build a robot. There are still many other opportunities on the team for you.</p>
